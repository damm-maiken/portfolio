        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>With a Master in Interaction Design from Aalborg University I have a passion for designing user-friendly solutions. I believe when we design with users we create the best solutions, therefore I am an expert in various user involvement such as interviews, usability testing, and workshops. <br style="break-after: column"> For me it is not enough to understand the users but also the developers, so the development process becomes so seamless as possible. Which is where my technical skills come into play, allowing me to bridge the gap between design and development.</p>
