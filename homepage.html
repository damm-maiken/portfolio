        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>With a Master’s in Interaction Design from Aalborg University, I have a strong passion for creating user-friendly solutions. I believe the best results come from designing with users, not just for them—which is why I specialize in various user involvement methods such as interviews, usability testing, and workshops. <br style= "break-after: column">
        For me, it’s not only about understanding the users, but also about understanding the developers. A seamless development process is key, and that’s where my technical skills come into play—helping me bridge the gap between design and development.</p>
